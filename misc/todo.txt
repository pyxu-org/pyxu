  Review StructureTensor

Sepand
  * Solver Tests
      Remaining: opt/solver/pds.py
  * Refactor docstrings, type hints, etc.
      Remaining: opt/solver/pds.py
  * Known Bugs
    * General
      * test_svdvals[SM, non-rectangular operators]
        Returned values always wrong (esp. for fat arrays).
        Probable cause: np.linalg.svd does not return the "true" singular values.
    * Stencil
      * test_value1D_svdvals[SM]
        Always incorrect for ND kernels (seperable & non-seperable)
        Did an experiment on NumPy backend:
          Changing svds() seed gives different results.
          Hunch: obtaining one of the smallest singular values, but not the smallest.
        Values are not extravagant however: the failure is acceptable.
    * Kron
      * test_interface_jacobian() fails if kron(A, B) == LinFunc
        and A (or B) is IdentityOp.
        Reason: corner case where kr(A, B) is IdentityOp(dim=1).
        Not a problem in practice.
    * NUFFT
      * test_value1D_svdvals() fails sometimes when k > 1.
        Reason unknown.
      * type[123]()
        Some tests fail only with DASK inputs.
        Reason unknown.
      * test_math(\d*)_lipschitz() fails when calling hutchpp(): non-contiguous axis.
    * Adam
      * test_value_fit() fails.
        This is expected since stochastic gradient estimate not guaranteed to always decrease the cost function.
        If running the solver until convergence, we notice the cost function increases, then decreases.
        Need to disable test_value_fit(), or xfail with error message?
    * JAX interop
      * The following tests fail with CuPy inputs (f32/f64), with mentioned errors. [Reason unknown.]
        - TestJaxScaledSum::test_math_adjoint()
            Execution of replica 0 failed: INVALID_ARGUMENT: Executable expected shape f32[20,1]{1,0} for argument 0 but got incompatible shape f32[20,1]{0,1}

        - TestJaxSquaredL2Norm::test_math_diff_lipschitz()
        - TestJaxSquaredL2Norm2::test_math_diff_lipschitz()
            Execution of replica 0 failed: INTERNAL: Address of buffer 0 must be a multiple of 10, but was 0x...
            Execution of replica 0 failed: INTERNAL: Address of buffer 1 must be a multiple of 10, but was 0x...

  * Test Suite Enhancements
    * General
      * Add @slow_test tags.
      * Add alternative tox instance to run non-@slow_test tests.
      * Add DASK_CUPY mode. [Only to the test suite.]
        >>> with dask.config.set({"array.backend": "cupy"}):  # "numpy"
        ...     darr = da.ones(10, chunks=(5,))  # Get cupy-backed collection
    * NUFFT
      * CuPy backend currently not tested since only kicks in/works when eps=0.
        Enable CuPy backend once eps>0 case also becomes CuPy-capable.



Thomas
  * Design tests for sampler module
  * When diff operators are merged, add examples in documentation of B-spline module (comparison splines vs. discrete model for nonuniform sampling)
    and Sampler module (ULA with TV regularization)
  * Long term for Sampler module : add documentation and utility functions to compute autocorrelation and effective sample size for MCMC models
    (investigate if they can be approximated online)
