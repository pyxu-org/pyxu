- ProximalOperator.moreau_envelope()
  + Add gradient rules for (\mu, op)

- LInfinityNorm()
  + Implement prox()

- math.svdvals()
  + Does not work if the operator is complex-valued?

- CZT
  + Speed up FFT by having a next_fast_len() function?
  + apply/adjoint() are correct, but grad() [and maybe jvp/vjp?] return the outputs conjugated.
    This does not match our definition of complex differentiation.
    Need to look into JAX's conventions before going any further.
    This problem is replicated when taking grad(SquaredL2Norm), among others.
